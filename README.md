# React Sortable Drag and Drop List Project

## Introduction
This project is a React-based implementation of a sortable drag and drop list. It allows users to interact with elements on the page by clicking and dragging them to different locations within a list, effectively changing the order of the list items.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: Used for building the user interface.
- **Sass**: Used for styling the webpage and the draggable list items.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **React Icons**: Used to include icons in the project.

## Features
- **Sortable List**: Users can click on a list item, drag it to a different location within the list, and drop it, thereby changing the order of the list items.
- **Visual Feedback**: The list item being dragged changes its appearance, providing visual feedback to the user.

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Open `http://localhost:5173/` in your web browser to view the webpage.
5. To drag a list item, click and hold the left mouse button on it, move it to the desired location within the list, and then release the mouse button to drop it.

## Build
To create a production build, run `npm run build`. Vite will create a `dist` folder with the production-ready website.

## Deploy
To deploy to GitHub, run `npm run deploy`.
